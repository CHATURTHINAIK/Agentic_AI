# 🧠 ContentWritingAgent – A LLM-Based Content Generation Agent

It demonstrates the principles of **Agentic AI** by acting as an expert content writer that adapts its output based on the user's intent, tone, format, and constraints.

## 🚀 How It Works

The agent is initialized with:
- A **name** (`ContentWritingAgent`)
- A system **instruction** defining its personality and capabilities
- A **Groq-hosted LLaMA 3.3 70B** model for natural language generation

It then responds to multiple prompts related to content writing, such as article generation, product description, motivational writing, and story planning.
