# 🤖 Agentic AI Project – Intelligent Goal-Driven Agents

## 🧠 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to the design and implementation of intelligent systems (agents) that can **set goals**, **plan**, **reason**, and **act autonomously** in dynamic environments. Unlike passive models, agentic systems actively **drive tasks toward completion**, adapting to user needs, preferences, and feedback.

This repository is a collection of multiple **LLM-powered agentic applications**, each tailored to solve real-world tasks with autonomy and intelligence.
